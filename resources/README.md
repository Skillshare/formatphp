# Resources

This is a sample application, giving you the ability to *play around* with
formatting messages, dates, times, numbers, and currency.

To run the sample application, type the following in your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Skillshare/formatphp.git
cd formatphp/
composer update
php -S localhost:9001 ./resources/public/index.php
```

Then, you may access the application in a web browser at <http://localhost:9001>.
