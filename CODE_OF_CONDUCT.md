# Community Guidelines

The Skillshare community is first and foremost, educational and centered around
skill-building. Skillshare defines our spirit as educational, instructional,
engaging and demonstrative. The goal of our community is knowledge expansion,
and we get there by guiding our users to flex their creative and analytical
muscles, engage in genuine interactions with the community and have a safe space
to share their work.

Skillshare open source projects follow the spirit and guidelines of our teacher
and student community. Our teachers and students – the community – are the pulse
of Skillshare. These guidelines are here to help you understand what it means to
be a member of Skillshare and a contributor to our open source projects, whether
you're interacting with each other or members of our team. Failure to abide by
these guidelines may result in strikes recorded to your Skillshare account,
removal or rejection of content (including comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions), a ban against all future contributions, or
Skillshare account deletion.
